<Callout type="warning">
If you are in a project that develops the GraphQL schema, you'll need `schema` rules.

If you are in a project that develops GraphQL operations (`query`/`mutation`/`subscription`), you'll
need `operations` rules.

If you are in a monorepo project, you probably need both sets of rules, see
[example of configuration](https://github.com/B2o5T/graphql-eslint/tree/master/examples/monorepo/eslint.config.js).

## Config Usage

For example, to enable the `schema-recommended` config, enable it in your `.eslintrc` file with the
`extends` option:

```diff filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["*.js"],
      "processor": "@graphql-eslint/graphql"
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.graphql"],
-     "parser": "@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin",
-     "plugins": ["@graphql-eslint"],
+     "extends": "plugin:@graphql-eslint/schema-recommended"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout>
  All configs under the hood set `parser` as `@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin` and add
  `@graphql-eslint` to `plugins` array, so you don't need to specify them.
