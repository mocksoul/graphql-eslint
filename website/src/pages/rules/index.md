# Overview

Each rule has emojis denoting:

- ğŸ“„ if the rule applies to schema documents
- ğŸ“¦ if the rule applies to operations
- ğŸš€ `graphql-eslint` rule
- ğŸ”® `graphql-js` rule
- ğŸ”§ if some problems reported by the rule are automatically fixable by the `--fix`
  [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) option
- ğŸ’¡ if some problems reported by the rule are manually fixable by editor
  [suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#providing-suggestions)
